Children: Michael and Joshua

Growing up on the Groot Drakenstein farm where Isaac lived with his Mom, everyone played rugby – a sport he wasn’t good at. Moving to the city in his teens, where everyone played soccer, he also didn’t fit in. Isaac made a conscious decision to do a sport that no one else in the community did. He chose surfing. That being the apartheid era, he was not allowed to surf in some of the best spots - but Isaac had chosen his sport well. Surfing fulfilled him, and when one of his three sons became a professional surfer at the age of 12, he decided to become active in surfing administration at Western Province Surfing, then at Surfing South Africa. 

For surfing’s Olympic debut at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, Isaac was tasked with managing the team that would pull together the South African team. While the Covid-19 pandemic interupted their dream, Isaac continues to provide leadership as the team is preparing for the Olympic qualifiers in El Salvador this year. He is resolute that racial diversity is embodied in the first South African surfing Olympics team.

Isaac is also passionate about paying it forward -- the influence of his Mom who, back home in Groot Drakenstein was community nurse, ambulance driver and Social Worker. Inspired by a teacher who saw his potential, Isaac pursued a career in graphic design. Through his graphic design business, Isaac actively trains interns and mentors small businesses. His company provides financial literacy programmes to thousands. It is important to him that Coloured people create “generational wealth” – that not only provides jobs and training to grow other people, but that will influence generations to come.
